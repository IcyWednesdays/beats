== Community Beats

The open source community has been hard at work developing new Beats. You can check 
out a few of them here:

[horizontal]
https://github.com/Ingensi/dockerbeat[dockerbeat]:: Reads docker container 
statistics and indexes them in Elasticsearch
https://github.com/mrkschan/nginxbeat[nginxbeat]:: Reads status from Nginx
https://github.com/joshuar/pingbeat[pingbeat]:: Sends ICMP pings to a list 
of targets and stores the round trip time (RTT) in Elasticsearch 

And remember, you can be a Beats developer, too. <<new-beat, Learn how>>

NOTE: Elastic provides no warranty or support for community-sourced Beats.
