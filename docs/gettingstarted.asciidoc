[[packetbeat-getting-started]]
== Getting started

The best way to understand the value of a network packet analytics system like
Packetbeat is to try it on your own traffic. 

=== Steps:

Get started with your own Packetbeat setup by:

 * installing Elasticsearch for storage and indexing the data. {libbeat}/getting-started.html#elasticsearch-installation[More details]
 * installing Kibana for the UI. {libbeat}/getting-started.html#kibana-installation[More details]
 * install optionally Logstash. {libbeat}/getting-started.html#logstash-installation[More details]

After you have Elasticsearch, Kibana and Logstash installed, you can start <<packetbeat-installation>>.

=== Installing Packetbeat

Now that you have Elasticsearch running, I'm sure you are eager to put some
data in it. For this, install the Packetbeat shippers on your application
servers:

deb:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo apt-get install libpcap0.8
curl -L -O https://download.elastic.co/beats/packetbeat/packetbeat_{version}_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i packetbeat_{version}_amd64.deb
----------------------------------------------------------------------

rpm:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo yum install libpcap
curl -L -O https://download.elastic.co/beats/packetbeat/packetbeat-{version}-x86_64.rpm
sudo rpm -vi packetbeat-{version}-x86_64.rpm
----------------------------------------------------------------------


mac:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -L -O https://download.elastic.co/beats/packetbeat/packetbeat-{version}-darwin.tgz
tar xzvf packetbeat-{version}-darwin.tgz
----------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: We also provide 32bits images. You can get them from our
https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/packetbeat[download page].


=== Configure Packetbeat

Before starting the shipper, edit the configuration file. For rpm and deb the
configuration file is `/etc/packetbeat/packetbeat.yml`. For mac the
configuration file is found in the archive you just downloaded.

First, select the network interface from which to capture the traffic. On
Linux, Packetbeat supports capturing all messages sent or received by the
server on which it is installed. For this, use `any` as the device:

[source,yaml]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
interfaces:
  # Select on which network interfaces to sniff. You can use the "any"
  # keyword to sniff on all connected interfaces.
  device: any
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that on OS X, capturing from the `any` device doesn't work. You would
typically use either `lo0` or `en0` depending on which traffic you want to
capture.

In the next section, configure the ports on which Packetbeat can find each
protocol. If you use any non-standard ports, add them here. Otherwise, the
default values should do just fine.

[source,yaml]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
protocols:
  # Configure which protocols to monitor and on which ports are they
  # running. You can disable a given protocol by commenting out its
  # configuration.
  http:
    ports: [80, 8080, 8081, 5000, 8002]

  memcache:
    ports: [11211]

  mysql:
    ports: [3306]

  redis:
    ports: [6379]

  pgsql:
    ports: [5432]

  thrift:
    ports: [9090]
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Set the IP address and port where the shipper can find the Elasticsearch
installation:

[source,yaml]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
output:

  elasticsearch:
    # Uncomment out this option if you want to output to Elasticsearch. The
    # default is false.
    enabled: true

    # Set the host and port where to find Elasticsearch.
    host: 192.168.1.42
    port: 9200

    # Uncomment this option and set it to true if you want to store the topology in
    # Elasticsearch. Default behavior if this setting is left out of the
    # config file is equivalent to setting "save_topology" to "false"
    #save_topology: false
----------------------------------------------------------------------


[[packetbeat-template]]
=== Load index template in Elasticsearch

Before starting Packetbeat, you need to load the
http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-templates.html[index
template], which is used to let Elasticsearch know which fields should be analyzed
in which way.

The recommended template file is installed by the Packetbeat packages. Load it with the
following command:

deb or rpm:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_template/packetbeat' -d@/etc/packetbeat/packetbeat.template.json
----------------------------------------------------------------------

mac:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
cd packetbeat-{version}-darwin
curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_template/packetbeat' -d@packetbeat.template.json
----------------------------------------------------------------------

where `localhost:9200` is the IP and port where Elasticsearch is listening on.

=== Running Packetbeat

You are now ready to start Packetbeat:

deb:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo /etc/init.d/packetbeat start
----------------------------------------------------------------------

rpm:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo /etc/init.d/packetbeat start
----------------------------------------------------------------------

mac:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo ./packetbeat -e -c packetbeat.yml -d "publish"
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Packetbeat is now ready to capture data from your network traffic. You can test
that it works by creating a simple HTTP request. For example:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl http://www.elastic.co/ > /dev/null
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Now check that the data is present in Elasticsearch with the following command:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/packetbeat-*/_search?pretty'
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure to replace `localhost:9200` with the address of your Elasticsearch
instance. It should return data about the HTTP transaction you just created.

=== Sample dashboards

In order to make it as easy as possible to get application performance insights
from packet data, we provide a few sample Kibana dashboards. The
dashboards are maintained in this
https://github.com/elastic/beats-dashboards[GitHub repository], which also
includes instructions for loading them.

Load automatically all the sample dashboards in Kibana by following the {libbeat}/getting-started.html#load-kibana-dashboards[steps].

These dashboards are provided as examples, we recommend that you
http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/dashboard.html[customize] them
to your needs.

Enjoy!
