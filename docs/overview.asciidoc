== Overview

The Packetbeat system consists of the following mandatory components:

 * The Packetbeat agent
 * Elasticsearch
 * Kibana

In addition, the following components can be used in more complex
architectures:

 * Logstash
 * Redis

Optionally, http://logstash.net[Logstash] can be installed side-by-side with
Packetbeat on the applications servers for gathering the log files. The same
Elasticsearch and Kibana instance that are used for analysing the network
traffic gathered by Packetbeat can be used for analysing the log files gathered
by Logstash. This way, you can have network traffic and log analysis in the
same system.

=== Packetbeat agent

Packetbeat agents sniff the traffic between your servers, parse on the fly the
application level protocols and correlates the messages into transactions.
Currently, the Packetbeat agent supports the following protocols:

 * HTTP
 * MySQL
 * PostgreSQL
 * Redis
 * Thrift-RPC

The agents can insert the correlated transactions directly into Elasticsearch
or via a central queue created with Redis and Logstash.

The agents can run on the same servers as your application processes or on
their own servers. When running on dedicated servers, they can get the traffic
from the switches mirror ports or from tapping devices. In such a deployment,
there is zero overhead on the monitored application!

=== Elasticsearch

After decoding the Layer 7 messages, Packetbeat correlates the requests with
the responses in what we call "transactions" and for each such transaction it
inserts a JSON document into http://elastic.co[Elastcisearch].
Elasticsearch is a popular search and analytics engine that is well fitted for
storing and analysing the kind of data that the Packetbeat agents are producing.

=== Redis + Logstash (optional)

Starting with Packetbeat version 0.3.0, the agents can also insert the transactions
in a Redis list. This makes it possible to use Redis + Logstash as a central collector
and queue for transactions data.

=== Kibana

The last component of the Packetbeat system is http://kibana.org[Kibana] which
provides the user interface layer. Kibana is a flexible analytics/BI UI
application that can display widgets like histogram charts, time series,
trends, etc. The Packetbeat version of Kibana includes custom widgets as well
as pre-made dashboards that are designed to make performance analysis easy.
