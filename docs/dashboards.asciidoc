== Sample dashboards

In order to make it as easy as possible to get application performance insights
from packet data, we provide a few sample Kibana dashboards. The
dashboards are maintained in this
https://github.com/elastic/beats-dashboards[GitHub repository], which also
includes instructions for loading them.

Load automatically all the sample dashboards in Kibana by following the {libbeat}/beats-getting-started.html#_load_kibana_dashboards[steps].

to your needs.
