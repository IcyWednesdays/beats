=== Packetbeat specific Options 

==== -I
Instead of reading packets from the network, you can pass a `PCAP` file as input to Packetbeat. 
This option is useful only for testing Packetbeat. Example: `-I ~/pcaps/network_traffic.pcap`.

==== -N
Disable publishing the events to the defined output. This option is useful only for testing Packetbeat.

==== -O
Read a packet one by one by pressing _Enter_ after each. This option is useful only for testing Packetbeat.

==== -devices
Print the list of devices. 

==== -dump
Write all captured packets to a file. This option is useful for troubleshooting Packetbeat.

==== -l
This option needs to be used in combination with the _pcap file input (-I)_ in order to define how many times to read
the pcap file. For a infinite loop, use _0_. This option is useful only for testing Packetbeat.

==== -t
This option needs to be used in combination with the _pcap file input (-I)_. If present, reads the packets from the pcap
file as fast as possible, without sleeping. This option is useful only for testing Packetbeat.

==== -waitstop
Additional seconds to wait before exiting.
