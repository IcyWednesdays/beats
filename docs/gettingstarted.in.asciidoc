== Getting started


The best way to understand the value of an network packet analytics system like
Packetbeat is to try it on your own traffic. This quick tutorial will walk you
through installing the essential components of the Packetbeat system:

 * Packetbeat shippers. They collect the traffic. You should install these on
   your servers so that they capture the network traffic.
 * Elasticsearch for storage and indexing.
 * Kibana for the UI.

For now, you can just install Elasticsearch and Kibana on a single VM or even
on your laptop. The only condition is that this machine is accessible from the
servers you want to monitor. As you add more shippers and your traffic grows, you
will want replace the single Elasticsearch instance with a cluster. You will
probably also want to automate the installation process.  But for now, let's
just do the fun part.

=== Elasticsearch installation

http://www.elasticsearch.org/[Elasticsearch] is a distributed real-time
storage, search and analytics engine. It can be used for many purposes, but one
context where it excels is indexing streams of semi-structured data, like logs
or decoded network packets.

The binary packages of Elasticsearch have only one dependency: Java. Choose the
tab that fits your system (deb for Debian/Ubuntu, rpm for Redhat/Centos/Fedora,
binary for the other Linux distributions):

deb:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre
curl -L -O https://download.elasticsearch.org/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-$ES_VERSION.deb
sudo dpkg -i elasticsearch-$ES_VERSION.deb
sudo /etc/init.d/elasticsearch start
----------------------------------------------------------------------

rpm:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk
curl -L -O https://download.elasticsearch.org/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-$ES_VERSION.noarch.rpm
sudo rpm -i elasticsearch-$ES_VERSION.noarch.rpm
sudo service elasticsearch start
----------------------------------------------------------------------

binary:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
# install Java, e.g. from: https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp
curl -L -O https://download.elasticsearch.org/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-$ES_VERSION.zip
unzip elasticsearch-$ES_VERSION.zip
cd elasticsearch-$ES_VERSION
./bin/elasticsearch
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can learn more about installing, configuring and running Elasticsearch in
http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/_installing_elasticsearch.html[Elasticsearch: The Definitive Guide].


To test that the Elasticsearch daemon is up and running, try sending a HTTP GET
request on port 9200:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl http://127.0.0.1:9200
{
  "status" : 200,
  "name" : "Unicorn",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "1.4.3",
    "build_hash" : "36a29a7144cfde87a960ba039091d40856fcb9af",
    "build_timestamp" : "2015-02-11T14:23:15Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "4.10.3"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------


=== Packetbeat installation

Now that you have Elasticsearch running, I'm sure you are eager to put some
data in it. For this, install the Packetbeat shippers on your application
servers:

deb:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo apt-get install libpcap0.8
curl -L -O https://download.elasticsearch.org/beats/packetbeat/packetbeat_$PKG_VERSION_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i packetbeat_$PKG_VERSION_amd64.deb
----------------------------------------------------------------------

rpm:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo yum install libpcap
curl -L -O https://download.elasticsearch.org/beats/packetbeat/packetbeat-$PKG_VERSION-x86_64.rpm
sudo rpm -vi packetbeat-$PKG_VERSION-x86_64.rpm
----------------------------------------------------------------------


binary:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
# install libpcap using your operating system package manager
curl -L -O https://download.elasticsearch.org/beats/packetbeat/packetbeat-$PB_VERSION-x86_64.tar.gz
tar xzvf packetbeat-$PB_VERSION-x86_64.tar.gz
----------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: We also provide 32bits images. You can get them from our
https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/packetbeat[download page].

Before starting the shipper, edit the configuration file:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo nano /etc/packetbeat/packetbeat.yml
----------------------------------------------------------------------

First, select the network interface from which to capture the traffic. Packetbeat
supports capturing all messages sent or received by the server on which it is
installed. For this, use `any` as the device:

[source,yaml]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
interfaces:
  # Select on which network interfaces to sniff. You can use the "any"
  # keyword to sniff on all connected interfaces.
  device: any
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In the next section, configure the ports on which Packetbeat can find each
protocol. If you use any non-standard ports, add them here. Otherwise, the
default values should do just fine.

[source,yaml]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
protocols:
  # Configure which protocols to monitor and on which ports are they
  # running. You can disable a given protocol by commenting out its
  # configuration.
  http:
    ports: [80, 8080, 8081, 5000, 8002]

  mysql:
    ports: [3306]

  redis:
    ports: [6379]

  pgsql:
    ports: [5432]

  thrift:
    ports: [9090]
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Set the IP address and port where the shipper can find the Elasticsearch
installation:

[source,yaml]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
output:

  elasticsearch:
    # Uncomment out this option if you want to output to Elasticsearch. The
    # default is false.
    enabled: true

    # Set the host and port where to find Elasticsearch.
    host: 192.168.1.42
    port: 9200

    # Comment this option if you don't want to store the topology in
    # Elasticsearch. The default is false.
    save_topology: true
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Before starting the shipper, you should also load an
http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-templates.html[index
template], which is used to tell Elasticsearch which fields should be analyzed
in which way.

The recommended template file is installed by the Packetbeat packages. Load it with the
following command:

deb or rpm:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_template/packetbeat' -d@/etc/packetbeat/packetbeat.template.json
----------------------------------------------------------------------

binary:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
cd packetbeat-$PB_VERSION
curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_template/packetbeat' -d@packetbeat.template.json
----------------------------------------------------------------------

where `localhost:9200` is the IP and port where Elasticsearch is listening on.

You are now ready to start the shipper:

deb:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo /etc/init.d/packetbeat start
----------------------------------------------------------------------

rpm:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo /etc/init.d/packetbeat start
----------------------------------------------------------------------

binary:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
cd packetbeat-$PB_VERSION
sudo ./packetbeat -c packetbeat.yml
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Packetbeat is now ready to capture data from your network traffic. You can test
that it works by creating a simple HTTP request. For example:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -L -i http://www.elastic.co/ > /dev/null
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Now check that the data is present in Elasticsearch with the following command:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/packetbeat-*/_search?pretty'
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure to replace `localhost:9200` with the address of your Elasticsearch
instance. It should return data about the HTTP transactions you just created.


=== Kibana installation

https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana[Kibana] is a visualization application
that gets its data from Elasticsearch. It provides a customizable and
user-friendly UI in which you can combine various widget types to create your
own dashboards. The dashboards can be easily saved, shared and linked.

For this tutorial, we recommend to install Kibana on the same server as
Elasticsearch, but it is not required.

Use the following commands to download and run Kibana:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -L -O https://download.elastic.co/kibana/kibana/kibana-$KIBANA_VERSION-linux-x64.tar.gz
tar xzvf kibana-$KIBANA_VERSION-linux-x64.tar.gz
cd kibana-$KIBANA_VERSION-linux-x64/
./bin/kibana
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can find Kibana binaries for other operating systems on the
https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana[Kibana downloads page].

If Kibana cannot reach the Elasticsearh server, you can adjust the settings for
it from the `config/kibana.yml` file.

Now point your browser to port 5601 and you should see the Kibana web
interface.

The first thing you need to do is to configure the index pattern. In
the *Index name or pattern* field enter `packetbeat-*` and for the *Time-field
name* select `timestamp`.

image:./images/kibana-index-pattern.png[Kibana index pattern]

If after you configure the `packetbeat-*` index pattern Kibana still says
_Unable to fetch mapping. Do you have indices matching the pattern?_, it means
that Packetbeat hasn't yet written any data into Elasticsearch. Make sure that
some traffic was running on your servers and that Packetbeat could see it.

If everything goes fine, you should already see some traffic reported by
Packetbeat under the Discover page:

image:./images/kibana-discover.png[Kibana discover page]

You can learn more about Kibana in the
http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/index.html[Kibana User Guide].

=== Sample Kibana dashboards

Kibana has a large set of visualization types which you can combine to create
the perfect dashboards for your needs. But this flexibility can be a bit
overwhelming at the beginning, so we have created a couple of
<<sample-dashboards,sample dashboards>> to give you a good start and to
demonstrate what is possible based on the packet data.

To load the sample pages, follow these steps:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -L -O https://download.elastic.co/beats/packetbeat/packetbeat-dashboards-$DASHBOARDS_VERSION.tar.gz
tar xzvf packetbeat-dashboards-$DASHBOARDS_VERSION.tar.gz
cd packetbeat-dashboards-$DASHBOARDS_VERSION/
./load.sh
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To open the loaded dashboards, go to the *Dashboard* page and click the "Open"
icon. Select *Packetbeat Dashboard* from the list. You can then switch easier
between the dashboards by using the *Navigation* widget.

Enjoy!
